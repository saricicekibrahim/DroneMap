# Drone Map  
Developed for showing my drone videos on a responsive map.

Uses OpenLayers 3 & BootStrap & AngularJs.  
Takes data from Google Fusion Tables & takes videos from YouTube.  
Filter on right panel appears on map & bbox changes appears on right panel.

A working demo is [here](http://dronemap.info)
