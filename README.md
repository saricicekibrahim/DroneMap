# Drone Map  
Developed for showing my drone videos on a responsive map.

Uses OpenLayers 3 & BootStrap & AngularJs. Tiles taken from maps.stamen.com  

Takes data from Google Fusion Tables   
(https://fusiontables.google.com/DataSource?docid=1MIt8HjHPRe4_rifTaAwpK72vJ6c-oJdoa5c8Ryd7) 
& takes videos from YouTube 
(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA6cpzyj3RGGqEW7MwbvajQ).  

Filter on right panel appears on map & bbox changes appear on right panel.

A working demo is [here](http://dronemap.info)
